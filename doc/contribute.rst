For contributing to Panic via pull requests I suggest to:

 - put any new api method within try/except/traceback clauses; so any bug is properly catched and printed
 - attach a piece of code for validating the behaviour
 - add an .rst file documenting the behaviour of the new feature
 
This three conditions will help me to evaluate the integration of new features into the device/api/gui
